## Why I created this?

I have created this Desktop software for College students like me to practice coding effectively.
Also, the basic materials used in this softwares, i.e. The set of Problems come from the DSA cracker sheet provided by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/lovebabbar-1">Love Babbar</a>.
I am so much thankful to him, as he took this great initiative to organize such huge volume of important codes and
providing this to everyone!

## What's special about it?

You can load the json file provided along with the package to this software and mark some problems as complete or not
complete.
And save your progress, you can view number of problems you solved and click links to open problems directly in your
browser.
_You basically don't have to open the excel sheet each time and edit and save them or copy-paste problem links to open
them!_

## Current Features:

- **Load DSA sheet** from any place you save (this is basically a JSON file generated from the excel sheet) in your
computer.

- You can either **Save-as** or **save** files.

- **Update Problems**, mark them as done or not done and save them.

- **Filter View:** View only solved problems or only unsolved problems

*_Note_: I haven't spend much time on creating this, just one evening, may be 2-3 hours, but I think doing this will
help many children.

# News:

- **New Update [29-10-2021]**: Added menu option to show all problems (`Ctrl + 3`) _[usage: after using selective
filter]_
- **Update**: Added color coding based on complete status of problems.
- **Update [02-12-2020]**: Now, You'll be able to add new problems through this application along with their links and
monitor them too.
